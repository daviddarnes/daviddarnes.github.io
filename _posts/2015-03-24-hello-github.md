# Io, GitHub

I've decided to follow the cool kids and start up a proper [github.io](https://pages.github.com/) site. For the time being I'll be leaving it at [daviddarnes.github.io](http://daviddarnes.github.io). However I'd like to also slowly transfer the articles from my current WordPress site to this one, with the plan to eventually move entirely over to this system and archive the WordPress site.

The switch to this was inevitable really. I dabbled with the idea, thinking it was pretty cool that I could not only have my whole site open source, but also be able to host it from the same place as well. GitHub Pages is a service where you are able to host the static content coming from any of your GitHub repos. This static content all hangs of the subdomain I mentioned above, daviddarnes.github.io. Think of this like your own subdomain, much in the same way tumblr gives you your own subdomain. For example, I have a repo on GitHub called [flynn](https://github.com/daviddarnes/flynn), which means I can host static content from that repo at [daviddarnes.github.io/flynn](http://daviddarnes.github.io/flynn/). To activate this feature in a repo simply create a branch called ```gh-pages```, and of course have some static content to show.
