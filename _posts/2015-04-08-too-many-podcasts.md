# I Listen To Too Many Podcasts

I've had to take a break from listening to podcasts as all I've been doing in playing catch up with every single episode of them, rather than listening to episodes I actually want to hear.

## The list

Here's a list of everything I am subsribed to on my podcasts app:

- [Reply All](http://gimletmedia.com/show/reply-all/)
- [ShopTalk](http://shoptalkshow.com/)
- [StartUp Podcast](http://gimletmedia.com/show/startup/)
- [99% Invisible](http://99percentinvisible.org/)
- [Design Details](http://www.designdetails.fm/)
- [Developer Tea](https://www.developertea.com/)
- [One Design Podcast](http://onedesign.guide/)
- [PageBreak Podcast](http://www.pagebreakpodcast.com/)
- [Narwhals](http://www.narwhals.cool/)
- [CodePen Radio](http://blog.codepen.io/radio/)

That's a lot, especially how most of them are on a weekly cycle. I wish they were all more like the [One Design Podcast](http://onedesign.guide/) and only worked on a fortnight basis, at least that way I could find a way to keep up.

_PS. That list is in order of preference, if you do want to listen to any then start from the top._

## In the meantime

For the time being I've taken a break and kept to music until I can easily dip my toe back into them again. I realise this might be a bit hypocritical since I work on a podcast in my spare time as well. In this case I will say that if you don't have time then don't listen. I'd hate to think listening to a podcast is stopping someone from being truly productive.
