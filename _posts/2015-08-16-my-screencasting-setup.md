# My Screencasting Setup

A while ago I created a screencast series called '[Baking Bread.li](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqG97mWmzNL7OFKjx0eXQpwpOaXFRM251)', this was in preparation for a course for Tuts+ called '[Building Websites with BaseKit](http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/courses/building-websites-with-basekit)'. In order to make the course I needed to get some equipment together.

Instead of simply listing out everything I used and writing out a long article, I decided to create a screencast showing my setup and to get myself back into creating video content. Check it out the video below, hopefully it'll help you make some decisions on your own setup:
