excerpt: "Feedback on the subject of my daily routine"

[Recently I wrote an article][1] about what my daily routine is and asked others to let me know what they do and what their thoughts were. Firstly I&#8217;d like to thank everyone who replied. I received a few [tweets][2], couple of [Google+][3] messages and even an email. All of them were a nice combination of casual, informative and comical in nature.

I&#8217;d like to kick off with an email from college friend and web developer [Benjamin Reid][4], who emailed me with a very detailed schedule of his average weekday:

*[Benjamin Reid][4]: Here&#8217;s my day, bog standard with nothing planned after work.*

  * *7:30 &#8211; New alarm time, I&#8217;ve been trying to wake up to grab some breakfast and catch up on [Instapaper][5]*
  * *8:30 &#8211; Usual wake up time. Showered and head to work around 9:00 by bike or car*
  * *9:30 &#8211; 6:00 Proper set in stone working hours, rarely work much past 6:00. Lucky in that respect*
  * *6:30 &#8211; Back home, cook some food and [play guitar][6] for some time away from the screen*
  * *7:30 &#8211; 11:30 &#8211; Work on any personal or freelance stuff*
  * *11:30 &#8211; 12:30 &#8211; Watch an episode of [Lost][7], currently going through it all again. Ha*
  * *1am &#8211; Bed*

*Interesting..? Ha. Possibly not. But in [Offscreen mag][8] (which if you haven&#8217;t read, do get yourself a copy, they&#8217;re brilliant) they have a whole section dedicated to this topic!*

Now there are a lot of difference between my day and Ben&#8217;s, but on the face of it he&#8217;s toiling away as much as I am. Maybe more so, as I think he gets more freelance in than I do at the minute. What I think he does well though is manage to fit in little things to break up the &#8216;work stuff&#8217; he has each day. Such as reading on [Instapaper][5], [playing guitar][6] and watching [Lost][7].

My excuse for not doing something similar? I would say that I have to travel further to get into work. However that isn&#8217;t a very good excuse, travelling to work is part of my job and I should think of it that way. I also have the benefit of still living at home, whereas Ben is having to rustle grub for himself, ergo I should be able to make time to do other things like he does.

This leads me onto a few tweets between myself and another web developer, [Dan Smith][9]. Dan simply said &#8220;you work too much&#8221;, which I took partly as a compliment but mostly as a relief. He also went onto say:

> [Dan Smith][9] &#8211; <cite><a title="Dan Smith on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/blistereduk">@blistereduk</a></cite>
>
> Its a whole different ballgame. Again when you get a house and stuff. Enjoy your time away from work. Lifes too short.

Dan is either saying to appreciate I don&#8217;t have a house to look after, or that when I do get one I should enjoy the time away from work when I&#8217;m there. I prefer the later as I do want to find a place of my own, and I&#8217;d like to think it would be a &#8216;no work&#8217; space… most of the time.

I also had a short conversation with [James Young][10], creative director at [Offroadcode][11]. He made a couple of great points that speak for themselves:

> [James Young][10] &#8211; <cite><a title="James Young on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/welcomebrand" data-user-id="40017708">@welcomebrand</a></cite>  
> Don&#8217;t let the fact you enjoy your job mean you&#8217;re doing it 16 hours a day. You WILL burn out!

> [James Young][10] &#8211; <cite><a title="James Young on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/welcomebrand" data-user-id="40017708">@welcomebrand</a></cite>  
> I make a point of getting out on time and having family time as much as possible

We both agreed that working for a long period on the same thing each day will simply tire you out. There is also a risk that you tire of doing your job in general. For example you might have been really excited to work on a project at the start, but 3 months later you&#8217;re sick of it no matter how good the design was at the start. I&#8217;d hate to think like that towards design in general.

So in review I need to 1. work less and 2. if I am working more than usual make sure to have regular breaks where I can do something more fun. I hope you found this helpful and that it can contribute in someway to making your daily work life a little easier.

Cheers, Dave
