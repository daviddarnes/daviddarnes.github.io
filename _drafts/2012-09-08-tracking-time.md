Not long ago I asked my Twitter followers what they suggest for a single person to track their time with. I was worried it might open up a can of worms, but I got an excellent response. Here&#8217;s what people suggested:

  * [Freeagent][1] suggested by [@alanhornedotcom][2] &#8211; Excellent not only for single users but also agencies, currently using this at work. Very good and seems to cover everything, my only issue is there&#8217;s no search in the contacts section
  * [Freshbooks][3] suggested by [@pealo86][4] &#8211; Looks very similar to [Freeagent][1], which can only be a good thing. Matt is a full time freelancer and he highly recommends this, so it seems this works really well for a solo designer/developer
  * [Eon][5] suggested by [@BenjaminReid][6] &#8211; Very sexy looking application, much closer to what I was looking for. Like the simple labelling and receipt that comes out of the bottom. Also has integration plug-ins for [Freeagent][1], [Freshbooks][3] and [Basecamp][7]
  * [Solo][8] suggested by [@culshaw][9] &#8211; Ian used [Freshbooks][3] before, he switched to [Solo][8] because of its slick design and lovely looking graphs. Additionally [Solo][8] is catered to solitary, or small team of, designers/developers
  * [Time Track Pro][10] suggested by [me][11] &#8211; This is approaching it from a different angle. Time Track Pro watches what applications, files & pages you look at and displays the amount of time spent on them in a simple window. Despite a very basic UI, and some slightly iffy design decisions, it does the job. Its the thing to go to when you ask yourself &#8220;what the hell have I been doing all morning!?&#8221;

[Alan][2] also sent me a nice article from [Freelance Switch][12] which listed [6 Cool Tools to Track Your Time][13]. Really great info from everyone on Twitter but I fear I was looking for something I didn&#8217;t really need. I already use [Time Track Pro][10] at work and its great to refer to when working on PSDs and web pages. So sorry to any of the guys if they feel like they were cheated by me, I will be looking back at this if I ever go freelance though!

Cheers, Dave
