Not sure if you know this, but your website might fall apart. Thats right, if you don&#8217;t keep it maintained and serviced it might not be there one day. This issue can only be described as &#8220;website decay&#8221; in which the site in question could simply fall apart at any moment.

I&#8217;ve recently had some trouble trying to prevent such a problem but I think I&#8217;ve managed to escape it with minor issues. However I have lost some elements in the process, a div here and there. So let this be a warning to anyone neglecting their own site, keep it in check and give it a good service every so often!

Here&#8217;s a great tutorial on how to keep your website [clean and fresh][1].

Cheers, Dave
