excerpt: And it only took me 6 months to get here

Back in August I accepted a role as web designer & front end developer for [effect][1] in Leicester. Its a great studio which is working with some awesome brands. Despite the friendly team and the strong momentum of work we were doing, I didn&#8217;t feel like the role was right for me. I was looking to work on something that was closer to my interests and allowed me to feed my design hunger as well.

<img class="alignright  wp-image-912" style="border: 0;" alt="basekit-logo" src="http://david.darn.es/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/basekit-logo.png" width="384" height="91" />Then, about a month before Christmas, a [friend][2] of a [friend][3] mentioned that a company in Bristol called [BaseKit][4] was looking for a web designer. I spent some time looking into who they were and what they did. [BaseKit][4] is a website editor designed for small businesses to create an online presence with ease. The product immediately spoke to me, it reminded me of the work I had already done for [JigoShop][5] and [Anchor Themes][6] even more so. In addition to this I had already been told many times that Bristol is a great city to live and work in, unsurprisingly by my friends that actually live there.

After a couple of conversations, and a lot of trips along the M5, I accepted the role as Template Designer and moved swiftly into a flat in the heart of Bristol. I&#8217;ve only worked at [BaseKit][4] for 2 weeks now, but I&#8217;m already enjoying the role. I design and build custom templates to work on the [BaseKit][4] platform, utilising not only my front end development skills but also my web design abilities.

What pleases me most about the whole thing is that the work I had been doing in my spare time ([Anchor Themes][6]) has helped me get this job. Its like someone has asked &#8220;That stuff you like doing in your spare time… would you like to do is as a day job?&#8221;.

My final thought is not only to thank the [BaseKit][4] team for giving me this opportunity, but also to thank the [effect][1] team in Leicester. Despite me being there only 3 months I had a great time and became good friends with the entire team. I wish them all the best and I hope we cross paths again.

Cheers, Dave
