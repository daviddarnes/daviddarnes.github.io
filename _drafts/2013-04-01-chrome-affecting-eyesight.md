But lately I&#8217;ve been noticing that the popular browser is affecting my eyesight, every time I spend long periods of time staring at Chrome I seem to go all blurry eyed and can&#8217;t focus properly.

Interested to know if anyone else is suffering from this issue, just [send us a tweet][1]. I&#8217;m hoping you can still read the link, because I&#8217;m certainly struggling!

Cheers, Dave
