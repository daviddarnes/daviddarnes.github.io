Here you can view a selection of my print and web design work, along with this blog where I will post about my recent ideas and thoughts.

Feel free to roam the site and if you would like to get in touch you can pop me a tweet via my <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/DavidDarnes" target="_blank">Twitter account</a>. I&#8217;d display an email on here, but I&#8217;ll get spammed to the high hills if I do.

Cheers, Dave
