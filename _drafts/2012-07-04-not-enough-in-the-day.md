title: Not Enough In The Day
author: David Darnes
excerpt: A normal weekday for me starts between 6:30am to 7:00am, depending on how much vigour I have. I then get ready, leave home and arrive at the Jigowatt studio at around 8:20am. I normally work until 5:30pm, maybe to 6:00pm depending on the workload.

My approach to writing articles is to remain very open minded in the subject matter. I have a great fear of saying &#8220;this is how it should be done&#8221; and then finding out its wrong or it can be done better. All I try to do is share my experience on the subject, and this one is no different.Â Anyway, I digress.

A normal weekday for me starts between 6:30am to 7:00am, depending on how much vigour I have. I then get ready, leave home and arrive at the [Jigowatt studio][1] at around 8:20am. I normally work until 5:30pm, maybe to 6:00pm depending on the workload. I then go home and continue to lookup stuff online, check twitter & alike and work on web stuff until around 11:30pm. So by using crude mathematics I&#8217;ve worked out that I&#8217;m working (with breaks) for about 16+ hours and sleeping for around 7 hours.

I bet you&#8217;re thinking thats all well and good David (for the average web designer) but why write this article? The reason is simple, is this right? Is this a normal day for everyone else? Maybe you&#8217;re a freelancer and you&#8217;re doing the same but at a different time. Or maybe you work full time and are managing to get a couple more hours of sleep. Let me know how you&#8217;re day is set out and if you think I&#8217;m doing it wrong. Best place to contact me is via <a title="DavidDarnes on Twitter" href="http://twitter.com/#!/daviddarnes" target="_blank">Twitter</a>. I&#8217;ll stick up peoples thoughts on it in a new article, hopefully we share a little advice on the matter.

Cheers, Dave
