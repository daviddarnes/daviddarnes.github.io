# New Site Structure Plans

I'm currently in the process of shifting things over from old to new with regards to my personal site. As many others, I also suffer from "leaving personal work until last". [In my last article related to this](https://github.com/daviddarnes/daviddarnes.github.io/blob/master/_posts/2015-03-24-hello-github.md) I said I'd be switching my WordPress content over from it to this site. Currently I've only transferred the articles and they are sitting in drafts right now.
